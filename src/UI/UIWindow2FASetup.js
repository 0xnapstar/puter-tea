    Plan:
        Components: OneAtATimeView < ... >

        Screen 1: QR code and entry box for testing
            Components: Flexer < QRCodeView, CodeEntryView, ActionsView >
            Logic:
            - when CodeEntryView has a value, check it against the QR code value...
              ... then go to the next screen
              - CodeEntryView will have callbacks: `verify`, `on_verified`
            - cancel action

        Screen 2: Recovery codes
            Components: Flexer < RecoveryCodesView, ConfirmationsView, ActionsView >
            Logic:
            - done action
            - cancel action
            - when done action is clicked, call /auth/configure-2fa/enable
