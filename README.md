## FAQ

### ❓ What's the use case for Puter?

Puter can be used as:

- An alternative to Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc. with a fresh interface and powerful features.
- Remote desktop environment for remote servers and workstations.
- A platform for building and hosting websites, web apps, and games.
- A friendly, open-source project and community to learn about web development, cloud computing, distributed systems, and much more!

### ❓ Why isn't Puter built with React, Angular, Vue, etc.?

For performance reasons, Puter is built with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery. Additionally, we'd like to avoid complex abstractions and to remain in control of the entire stack, as much as possible.

Also partly inspired by some of our favorite projects that are not built with frameworks: [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/), and [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/).

### ❓ Why jQuery?

Puter interacts directly with the DOM and jQuery provides an elegant yet powerful API to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and much more. It's also fast, mature, and battle-tested.
